## Purpose of This Journey

I started this coding challenge to improve my algorithm skills, which I currently find challenging. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving abilities in JavaScript, starting from the very basics and progressively tackling more complex problems. Through consistent practice and learning, I aim to build a solid foundation in JavaScript, preparing myself for more advanced concepts and frameworks like React. This repository documents my journey of growth and improvement in programming.

## How to Use

Each day has separate HTML and JavaScript files. For example, you can find the first day's coding task in the `day1.html` and `day1.js` files. The code will be commented with explanations and solutions.
